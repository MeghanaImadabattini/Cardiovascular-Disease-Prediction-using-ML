Cardiovascular Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

My research looks at how different lifestyle, clinical, and demographic factors contribute to cardiovascular disease. Using data from over 70,000+ people, I apply machine learning methods such as logistic regression, random forests, and decision trees to predict disease risk.

Early results show strong links between heart disease and factors like blood pressure, cholesterol, and smoking. With these models, we can predict outcomes with about 71% accuracy.

This work helps us better understand what drives heart disease and provides insights to design preventive strategies that can improve public health.
